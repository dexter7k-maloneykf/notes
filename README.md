- "Programming wisdom for today: Write code that is clear and easy to understand, not just for yourself but for others who may need to read or modify it in the future. This means using descriptive variable names, commenting your code thoroughly, and organizing your code into logical modules or functions. Remember, code is read many more times than it is written, so invest time in making it readable and maintainable."
